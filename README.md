# React + Vite Todo List

This is a simple Todo List application built using React and Vite that I referred from youtube to learn react.

## Features

- Add, remove and mark tasks as completed in a Todo list.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone `https://github.com/vk-cds/react-TODO.git`
    cd `react-TODO`
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```


### Usage

- Enter a task in the input field and press `add` button to add it to the todo list.
- Click the `delete` button to delete a task.
- Click the checkbox to mark a task as completed.
